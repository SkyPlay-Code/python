## 🛰️ 1. CV_SciFi_Prototypes (The Showcase)
*Advanced Computer Vision experiments using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and YOLOv8.*

| Feature | Script | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Holographic UI** | `minority_report_workspace.py` | Grab, scale, and "throw" holographic data windows with hand gestures. |
| **Neural Link** | `t800_terminator_targeter.py` | T-800 HUD: Calibrate your head as a joystick to track and lock onto objects. |
| **Invisibility** | `stealth_cloak.py` | Predator-style refraction cloak. Activated only when your lips are sealed. |
| **Reality Tear** | `aeon_dimension_tear.py` | Use your index finger to "tear" the screen into a digital cyber-dimension. |
| **Gaming** | `weeping_angel_simulator.py` | *Don't Blink.* The Angel moves when you close your eyes or look away. |
| **Spatial Art** | `soul_mirror.py` | Ethereal particles and mandalas emitted from your pupils in real-time. |
| **Privacy** | `biometric_void_scrambler.py` | Protect your identity with a high-tech digital void "mask" that tracks your face. |
| **Combat AI** | `combat_analyzer.py` | Train a custom ML model to distinguish between combat stances and passive moves. |
| **3D Scanning** | `face_scanner.py` | A "LiDAR" simulation that fuses multiple head angles into a 3D `.obj` model. |
| **Time Travel** | `temporal_hand_rift.py` | Wave your hand to see the past (delayed buffer) through a rift in the air. |

## 🤖 2. AI & Intelligent Automation (`ai_auto/`)
*Harnessing Google Gemini and Neural Networks for high-level tasks.*

*   **Gemini Core:** Text generation (`gemini-text.py`), visual reasoning (`gemini-image.py`), and complex "thinking" models (`gemini-thinking.py`).
*   **The Coder:** `ai_auto.py` & `coder.py` — Natural language to executable code. It writes, saves, and runs Python/JS/Shell scripts on command.
*   **GANs & Creative AI:** Fashion generation (`GAN-fashion.py`), colorizing images (`GAN-color_img.py`), and NLP poetry generators.
*   **Deep Learning:** From-scratch MNIST digit recognition (`neural_net-digits.py`) and reinforcement learning (`CartPole.ipynb`).

## 🛠️ 3. Universal Conversion Suite (`file_conversion/`)
*A robust "Swiss Army Knife" for every file format you will ever encounter.*

Launched via **`main.py`**, this suite handles:
*   **Video/Audio:** High-speed transcoding using FFmpeg (MP4, MKV, MP3, WAV, FLAC).
*   **Documents:** PDF to Word, PowerPoint to PDF, and Ebook (EPUB/MOBI) conversions.
*   **Media:** Comprehensive Image conversion (WebP, RAW, HEIC) and Font (TTF/OTF) processing.
*   **Archives:** Seamlessly convert between ZIP, 7Z, and TAR formats.

---

## 🧪 4. Miscellaneous & "Swiss" Utils (`misc/`)
*The "I needed this yesterday" folder of handy scripts.*

*   **`pdf_down-merge.py`**: Asynchronously downloads batches of PDFs and merges them into one optimized document.
*   **`scraper.py`**: Scrapes thousands of educational Drive links from web portals.
*   **`mouse_glide.py`**: Simulates human-like mouse movement and scrolling to prevent system sleep.
*   **`donut.py`**: The classic 3D spinning ASCII donut rendered entirely in math.
*   **`driving-license.py`**: A complex logic-flow simulation for digital applications with OTP/Captcha verification.
*   **`3d_shapes.py`**: High-precision geometry calculator for volume, surface area, and diagonals.
